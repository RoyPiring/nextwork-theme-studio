## Install

Works in Chrome, Brave and Edge. Takes about a minute.

![Install in five steps](docs/img/install.svg)

**1. Download it.** Get the archive for your browser from
[the latest release](https://github.com/RoyPiring/nextwork-theme-studio/releases/latest)
and unzip it. Chrome, Brave and Edge use the same build.

Prefer git? `git clone https://github.com/RoyPiring/nextwork-theme-studio`

**2. Open your browser's extensions page.**

| Browser | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Chrome | `chrome://extensions` |
| Edge | `edge://extensions` |
| Brave | Menu → Extensions → **Manage Extensions** |

> **Brave:** do not type `brave://extensions`. That page has no Developer mode
> switch.

**3. Turn on Developer mode.** The switch is in the top right.

**4. Click Load unpacked** and choose the folder you downloaded. Pick the
folder itself, not a file inside it. It is the one containing `manifest.json`.

**5. Open nextwork.ai.** The colours change straight away.

There is nothing to build and nothing to compile. Press `Alt+Shift+D` to turn
the theme on and off.

**Firefox and Safari** need an extra step →
[installing on other browsers](docs/install/)

## Use it

Click the extension icon in your toolbar.

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Theme** | Turns the colours on and off. |
| **Wallpaper** | Turns the picture behind the page on and off. |
| **Focus** | A timer that sits on the page while you work. |
| **Beside your work** | A small pane over the page, for something to keep in view. |
| **Surprise me** | Picks a theme at random. |
| **Dials** | Tint, saturation, contrast and brightness, all at once. |
| **Open editor** | Full control of all nine colours, with a live contrast score. |

The 18 built-in themes cannot be edited. Change a colour and the extension
makes you a copy, leaving the original alone. Your themes are saved on your own
computer. They are never uploaded.

**Focus timer.** Choose 5, 10, 15, 25, 45 or 60 minutes, or count up. A pill
appears in the corner while you work. It only shows on project pages, keeps
running across tabs, and counts past zero so you can see when you go over. When
the session reaches its length it can chime and flash red until you look at it;
both can be turned off.

**Beside your work.** For one screen. Paste a link in the popup and it becomes
a tile; the pane floats over the page with that link in it, and you drag its
bar to move it and its corner to resize it. It stays where you put it.

A YouTube link works — paste the address from your browser's bar and it plays.
Most other sites, Discord among them, refuse to be shown inside another page.
That is their own setting, and the pane does not fight it: it says so, and the
arrow in its bar opens the site in a small window of its own instead.

## Themes and wallpapers

Every theme has its own picture and its own drifting scenery, and no two are
the same. Nothing is downloaded while you browse, apart from a link you put in the
pane yourself.

Text on nextwork.ai sits straight on the page background, so you read it
*through* the picture. Every wallpaper is measured and held to a contrast ratio
of 7:1 where the text sits.
